= Ateles

Ateles is a web spider written in JavaScript.  It uses YQL via JSON-P
to get around the cross-domain issues that immediately crop up when
contemplating writing a JavaScript web spider...

Ateles is really just a toy -- you wouldn't want to orchestrate a
long, complex, or big scrape using it.

It is kind of cool for playing with a scrape in real-time though.
